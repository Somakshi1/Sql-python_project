# SQL-Python Project

## 📌 Overview
This project integrates SQL with Python to perform data analysis, database operations, and automation tasks. It demonstrates how Python can interact with databases using SQL queries to fetch, manipulate, and visualize data efficiently.

# Dataset Description: 
This Dataset on Kaggle includes sales data for various products sold by an e-commerce platform. The `products.csv` file specifically contains details about the products, such as their names, prices, and categories. This dataset is useful for analyzing consumer behavior, product performance, and sales trends in an online retail context. The data can support tasks like predictive modeling, trend analysis, and optimization of product offerings.

# Data Wrangling:
Our data can be found on `noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv` file provided on this repository, downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv [Kaggle]


## 🔧 Features
- Connect Python with SQL databases (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python
- Automate SQL queries with Python scripts
- Data visualization and reporting using Pandas & Matplotlib
- Error handling and performance optimization

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Somakshi1/Sql-python_project.git
   cd Sql-python_project
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configure the database connection**:
   - Update `config.py` with your database credentials.
   - Ensure the database server is running.
5. **Run the project**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **SQL (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL)** 🗄️
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** 📊
- **Flask/FastAPI (if applicable for API integration)** 🚀

## 📖 Usage
- Modify `database.sql` to define your database schema.
- Use `main.py` to execute SQL queries via Python.
- Add custom scripts inside the `scripts/` folder for automation.
